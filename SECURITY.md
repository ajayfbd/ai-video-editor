## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Report privately via GitHub Security Advisories
1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
   - **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
   - **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
   - **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for a fix

### 3. Alternative reporting methods
If GitHub Security Advisories are not available, you can:
- Email the maintainers (check repository for contact information)
- Create a private issue (if the repository supports it)

## 📋 What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Affected components** (specific modules, functions, or files)
- **Attack scenario** (how an attacker could exploit this)
- **Impact assessment** (what data or systems could be compromised)
- **Reproduction steps** (detailed steps to reproduce the issue)
- **Proof of concept** (if applicable, but avoid destructive examples)
- **Suggested mitigation** (if you have ideas for fixes)

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **Initial response**: 48 hours
- **Triage and assessment**: 1 week
- **Fix development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Rotate keys regularly** and revoke unused keys
- **Limit API key permissions** to minimum required scope

### Environment Security
```bash
# Use .env files (never commit these)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual keys

# Set proper file permissions
chmod 600 .env
```

### Input Validation
- **Validate all inputs** before processing
- **Sanitize file paths** to prevent directory traversal
- **Limit file sizes** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Validate media files** before processing

### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
- **Validate SSL certificates** in production
- **Implement rate limiting** for API calls
- **Monitor for unusual activity**

## 🔍 Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

#### Input Sanitization
```python
# File path validation
def validate_file_path(file_path: str) -> bool:
    # Prevent directory traversal
    if ".." in file_path or file_path.startswith("/"):
        return False
    return True

# Content validation
def validate_media_file(file_path: str) -> bool:
    # Check file type and size
    allowed_extensions = ['.mp4', '.avi', '.mov', '.mp3', '.wav']
    return any(file_path.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in allowed_extensions)
```

#### API Key Management
```python
# Secure API key loading
def load_api_key() -> str:
    api_key = os.getenv('AI_VIDEO_EDITOR_GEMINI_API_KEY')
    if not api_key or api_key == 'your_gemini_api_key_here':
        raise ValueError("Valid API key required")
    return api_key
```

#### Error Handling
```python
# Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
try:
    process_video(file_path)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Processing failed: {type(e).__name__}")
    # Don't expose internal details to users
    raise ProcessingError("Video processing failed")
```

### Security Configurations

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security settings
AI_VIDEO_EDITOR_DEBUG=false                    # Disable in production
AI_VIDEO_EDITOR_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING             # Reduce log verbosity
AI_VIDEO_EDITOR_MAX_MEMORY_USAGE_GB=8.0       # Prevent resource exhaustion
AI_VIDEO_EDITOR_API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30        # Prevent hanging requests
```

#### File System Security
```python
# Secure temporary file handling
import tempfile
import os

def create_secure_temp_file():
    fd, path = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix='ai_video_', suffix='.tmp')
    os.close(fd)
    # Set restrictive permissions
    os.chmod(path, 0o600)
    return path
```

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### API Dependencies
- **Gemini API**: Ensure API keys are kept secure and rotated regularly
- **External services**: Monitor for service-specific security advisories
- **Rate limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent abuse

### File Processing
- **Media files**: Large files can cause memory exhaustion
- **Temporary files**: Ensure proper cleanup to prevent disk space issues
- **File permissions**: Set appropriate permissions on generated files

### Memory Management
- **Large videos**: Can cause out-of-memory conditions
- **Concurrent processing**: Multiple processes can exhaust system resources
- **Cache management**: Implement proper cache cleanup

## 🔧 Security Development Guidelines

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Secure file handling and permissions
- [ ] Resource limits and timeout handling
- [ ] Dependency security scanning

### Testing Security
```bash
# Run security linting
bandit -r ai_video_editor/

# Check for known vulnerabilities
safety check

# Dependency scanning
pip-audit
```

### Secure Dependencies
```bash
# Pin dependency versions
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Regular security updates
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
