Let's process your first video with default settings:

```bash
# Replace 'your-video.mp4' with your actual video file
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process your-video.mp4
```

**What happens during processing:**

1. **Audio Analysis** (1-2 minutes)
   - Transcribes speech using Whisper
   - Identifies key concepts and emotions
   - Detects filler words and pauses

2. **Video Analysis** (1-2 minutes)
   - Analyzes visual content and highlights
   - Detects faces and important scenes
   - Identifies optimal cut points

3. **AI Director Planning** (30-60 seconds)
   - Creates editing strategy
   - Plans B-roll opportunities
   - Develops metadata approach

4. **Asset Generation** (2-4 minutes)
   - Generates thumbnail variations
   - Creates B-roll content (charts, animations)
   - Optimizes metadata packages

5. **Video Composition** (1-3 minutes)
   - Assembles final edited video
   - Integrates B-roll and enhancements
   - Applies professional finishing

## 📁 Step 4: Explore Your Results

After processing completes, you'll find your results in the `output/` directory:

## 🎥 Step 5: Review Your Enhanced Video

Open `output/video/enhanced_video.mp4` to see your AI-enhanced video:

**What to look for:**
- ✅ **Cleaner audio** with reduced filler words
- ✅ **Professional cuts** at natural speech breaks
- ✅ **B-roll integration** for key concepts
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** and pacing
- ✅ **Enhanced visual flow** and engagement

## 🖼️ Step 6: Explore Thumbnail Options

Check the `output/thumbnails/` directory for multiple thumbnail strategies:

**Emotional Thumbnails** (`emotional/`)
- Based on peak emotional moments
- Captures genuine expressions
- High engagement potential

**Authority Thumbnails** (`authority/`)
- Professional, credible appearance
- Educational context indicators

- Knowledge gap emphasis

**Pro Tip:** The `recommended.jpg` file is the AI's top choice based on your content analysis.

## 📝 Step 7: Use Your Optimized Metadata

Open `output/metadata/synchronized_package.json` to see your complete metadata package:

```json
{
  "recommended_title": "Complete Guide to [Your Topic] - Step-by-Step Tutorial",
  "description": "Learn [key concepts] with clear examples and practical applications...",
  "tags": ["tutorial", "education", "how-to", "beginner-friendly"],
  "thumbnail_strategy": "authority",
  "estimated_ctr": 0.145,
  "seo_score": 0.87
}
```

**How to use this:**
1. **YouTube Title**: Use the recommended title or choose from variations
2. **Description**: Copy the optimized description with timestamps
3. **Tags**: Add the suggested tags to improve discoverability
4. **Thumbnail**: Upload the recommended thumbnail image
