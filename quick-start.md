## ‚öôÔ∏è Quality Settings

Choose the right balance of quality and processing speed:

```bash
# Fast processing (good for previews)
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process video.mp4 --quality low --mode fast

# Balanced processing (recommended)
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process video.mp4 --quality medium --mode balanced

# High quality (best for final production)
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process video.mp4 --quality high --mode high_quality

# Ultra quality (maximum settings)
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process video.mp4 --quality ultra --mode high_quality
```

## üîß Essential Commands

### Basic Processing
```bash
# Process with specific content type
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process video.mp4 --type educational --quality high

# Custom output directory
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process video.mp4 --output ./results
```

### Quick Operations
```bash
# Audio enhancement only
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process input.mp4 --quality high --output enhanced.mp4

# Content analysis only
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process audio.mp3 --type general --output transcript.txt

# Batch processing (parallel by default)
python -m ai_video_editor.cli.main process *.mp4 --output ./batch_results
```

## üÜò Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Out of memory | Close other apps, use `--quality low --mode fast` |
| Slow processing | Check internet connection, use `--quality medium --mode balanced` |
| API errors | Verify API keys and Google Cloud billing |
| Import errors | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

## üìä Performance Tips

- **Close other applications** to free up memory (8GB+ RAM recommended)
- **Use SSD storage** for faster file access
- **Ensure stable internet** for AI services
- **Start with balanced quality** for best results/speed ratio
- **Monitor system resources** with built-in tools
- **Use batch mode** for multiple videos

## üß™ Verify Installation

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working:
```bash
# Quick unit tests (fast)
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Full test suite (slower)
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
