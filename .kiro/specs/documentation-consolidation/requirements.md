# Documentation Consolidation Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Video Editor project has accumulated extensive documentation across multiple files and directories, resulting in significant redundancy, inconsistency, and maintenance overhead. This feature aims to consolidate, streamline, and optimize the documentation structure while preserving all essential information and improving user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation Audit and Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want to easily find relevant information without encountering duplicate or conflicting content, so that I can efficiently understand and use the AI Video Editor system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting a documentation audit THEN the system SHALL identify all duplicate content across documentation files
2. WHEN analyzing documentation structure THEN the system SHALL catalog all redundant sections, overlapping information, and inconsistent messaging
3. WHEN reviewing content quality THEN the system SHALL identify outdated, conflicting, or unnecessary information
4. IF documentation contains multiple versions of the same information THEN the system SHALL flag these for consolidation
5. WHEN examining user workflows THEN the system SHALL identify gaps in documentation coverage

### Requirement 2: Consolidated Documentation Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear, logical documentation hierarchy that guides me from basic setup to advanced usage, so that I can progressively learn the system without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the new structure THEN the system SHALL organize documentation into clear categories: Getting Started, User Guide, Developer Guide, API Reference, and Support
2. WHEN consolidating content THEN the system SHALL merge duplicate information into single, authoritative sources
3. WHEN organizing information THEN the system SHALL create clear navigation paths from basic to advanced topics
4. IF multiple files contain similar information THEN the system SHALL combine them into comprehensive single sources
5. WHEN structuring content THEN the system SHALL ensure each document has a single, clear purpose

### Requirement 3: Content Optimization and Standardization

**User Story:** As a content maintainer, I want consistent formatting, terminology, and structure across all documentation, so that maintenance is efficient and user experience is uniform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standardizing content THEN the system SHALL apply consistent formatting, headers, and code block styles across all documents
2. WHEN reviewing terminology THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent use of technical terms and concepts throughout
3. WHEN optimizing content THEN the system SHALL remove redundant explanations while preserving essential information
4. IF content exists in multiple formats THEN the system SHALL standardize to the most effective presentation
5. WHEN updating examples THEN the system SHALL ensure all code examples are current and functional

### Requirement 4: Cross-Reference and Navigation System

**User Story:** As a user navigating the documentation, I want clear links and references between related topics, so that I can easily find additional relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating cross-references THEN the system SHALL establish clear links between related documentation sections
2. WHEN organizing navigation THEN the system SHALL create logical pathways between beginner and advanced topics
3. WHEN linking content THEN the system SHALL ensure all internal links are functional and point to consolidated locations
4. IF content is moved or consolidated THEN the system SHALL update all references to maintain link integrity
5. WHEN structuring information THEN the system SHALL create clear "next steps" guidance in each document

### Requirement 5: Redundancy Elimination

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to eliminate duplicate content while preserving all essential information, so that maintenance overhead is minimized and content remains accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying duplicates THEN the system SHALL catalog all instances of repeated information across files
2. WHEN consolidating content THEN the system SHALL merge duplicate sections into single, comprehensive sources
3. WHEN removing redundancy THEN the system SHALL preserve all unique and valuable information
4. IF multiple files contain overlapping content THEN the system SHALL create authoritative single sources with appropriate cross-references
5. WHEN eliminating duplicates THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility through redirects or clear migration paths

### Requirement 6: Quality Assurance and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate, up-to-date documentation that reflects the current system capabilities, so that I can rely on the information for successful implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating content THEN the system SHALL verify all code examples are functional and current
2. WHEN checking accuracy THEN the system SHALL ensure all feature descriptions match current implementation
3. WHEN reviewing completeness THEN the system SHALL identify and fill any gaps in documentation coverage
4. IF outdated information is found THEN the system SHALL update or remove it appropriately
5. WHEN finalizing documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure all links, references, and examples are working correctly

### Requirement 7: User Experience Optimization

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear, progressive documentation that guides me from installation to advanced usage, so that I can successfully implement the AI Video Editor without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing user journeys THEN the system SHALL create clear paths from basic setup to advanced features
2. WHEN structuring content THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate information density for each user level
3. WHEN presenting information THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting and clear headings for easy scanning
4. IF users need quick reference THEN the system SHALL provide concise summary sections and quick-start guides
5. WHEN designing navigation THEN the system SHALL ensure users can easily find relevant information for their current task

### Requirement 8: Maintenance and Sustainability

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a documentation structure that is easy to maintain and update, so that documentation remains current with minimal effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the new structure THEN the system SHALL minimize the number of files requiring updates for common changes
2. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL create clear ownership and maintenance responsibilities for each section
3. WHEN designing the system THEN the system SHALL enable easy identification of outdated or incorrect information
4. IF content needs updating THEN the system SHALL provide clear processes for maintaining accuracy
5. WHEN implementing changes THEN the system SHALL ensure updates propagate appropriately throughout the documentation system
