# Documentation Consolidation Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze existing documentation structure and identify redundancies
  - Scan all documentation files in the project root and docs/ directory
  - Create a content map identifying duplicate sections, overlapping information, and inconsistent messaging

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Create consolidated quick-start documentation
  - Merge README.md and quick-guide.md into a streamlined quick-start.md
  - Extract essential 5-minute setup information while removing redundant explanations
  - Ensure all code examples are current and functional
  - Create clear navigation links to detailed documentation
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.1, 3.3, 6.1_

- [x] 3. Consolidate user guide documentation
  - Merge docs/user-guide/README.md and docs/user-guide/getting-started.md into comprehensive sections
  - Eliminate duplicate installation and setup instructions
  - Create clear workflow sections for educational, music, and general content types
  - Standardize CLI reference information into single authoritative source
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Merge project status and analysis documents
  - Consolidate COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md, CONSOLIDATED_TASK_STATUS.md, and TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
  - Create single docs/support/project-status.md with current, accurate project state
  - Remove outdated status information and conflicting project completion percentages
  - Preserve essential technical details and test results
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 6.2, 6.4_

- [x] 5. Standardize developer documentation structure
  - Consolidate API reference information from multiple sources into docs/developer/api-reference.md
  - Merge architecture information from docs/developer/architecture.md with steering file content
  - Create comprehensive testing documentation combining steering/testing-strategy.md with existing test docs
  - Ensure consistent code examples and technical terminology throughout
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Optimize tutorial and workflow documentation
  - Consolidate workflow information from multiple sources into clear, progressive tutorials
  - Remove duplicate workflow examples and standardize format across all tutorials
  - Create clear learning paths from beginner to advanced usage
  - Ensure all tutorial examples are tested and functional
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3, 6.1, 7.1_

- [x] 7. Create unified troubleshooting and support documentation
  - Merge troubleshooting information scattered across multiple files
  - Consolidate FAQ content and remove duplicate questions
  - Create comprehensive performance optimization guide combining steering guidelines with user documentation
  - Standardize error message documentation and recovery procedures
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.1_

- [x] 8. Implement cross-reference and navigation system





  - Update all internal links to point to consolidated documentation locations
  - Create clear navigation paths between related topics
  - Implement "next steps" guidance in each major document section
  - Ensure all cross-references are functional and point to correct consolidated locations
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Validate content accuracy and completeness






  - Test all code examples to ensure they work with current system implementation
  - Verify all feature descriptions match current capabilities
  - Update outdated API references and configuration examples
  - Ensure all CLI commands and options are accurately documented
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 3.3_


 [-] 10. Archive redundant files and clean up project structure

- [x] 10. Archive redundant files and clean up project structure






  - Remove or archive original redundant files (quick-guide.md, old status documents)
  - Update README.md to focus on project overview and link to quick-start.md
  - Clean up any remaining duplicate content in project root
  - Ensure backward compatibility through redirects where necessary

  - _Requirements: 2.1, 8.2, 8.4, 4.4_


- [x] 11. Implement quality assurance and maintenance procedures





  - Create automated validation for cross-references and link integrity
  - Establish clear ownership and maintenance responsibilities for each documentation section

  - Create guidelines for future documentation updates to prevent redundancy

  - Create guidelines for future documentation updates to prevent redundancy
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4_
-

- [x] 12. Conduct final validation and user experience testing





  - Verify all user journeys have complete documentation coverage
  - Test navigation paths for different user types (new users, developers, advanced users)
  - Ensure consistent formatting and terminology across all consolidated documents
  - Validate that all essential information has been preserved through consolidation process
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 5.3_
