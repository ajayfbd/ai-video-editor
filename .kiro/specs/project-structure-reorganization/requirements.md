# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Video Editor project has grown organically and now requires structural reorganization to improve maintainability, discoverability, and developer experience. The current structure has scattered files, mixed concerns, and unclear organization that makes it difficult for new developers to understand the project layout and for maintainers to efficiently manage the codebase.

This reorganization will create a clean, intuitive project structure that follows Python packaging best practices while maintaining all existing functionality and backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want to quickly understand the project structure so that I can start contributing effectively without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the root directory THEN they SHALL see a clear, logical organization with no more than 10 top-level items
2. WHEN a developer looks for examples THEN they SHALL find them organized by complexity level (basic, advanced, workflows)
3. WHEN a developer needs development tools THEN they SHALL find them in a dedicated tools directory with clear categorization
4. WHEN a developer examines the structure THEN they SHALL be able to distinguish between production code, development tools, documentation, and examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want organized tools and scripts so that I can efficiently manage project maintenance tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a maintainer needs validation scripts THEN they SHALL find them in tools/validation directory
2. WHEN a maintainer needs development utilities THEN they SHALL find them in tools/development directory
3. WHEN a maintainer needs maintenance scripts THEN they SHALL find them in tools/maintenance directory
4. WHEN a maintainer runs any tool THEN they SHALL have clear documentation on its purpose and usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user learning the system, I want examples organized by complexity so that I can progress from basic to advanced usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user looks for basic examples THEN they SHALL find simple, single-concept demonstrations in examples/basic
2. WHEN a user wants advanced examples THEN they SHALL find complex integration examples in examples/advanced
3. WHEN a user needs workflow examples THEN they SHALL find end-to-end scenarios in examples/workflows
4. WHEN a user examines any example THEN they SHALL find clear documentation explaining its purpose and complexity level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want clean separation between production code and development artifacts so that I can focus on relevant files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer examines the main package THEN they SHALL see only production code without development artifacts
2. WHEN a developer looks at the root directory THEN they SHALL see only essential configuration files
3. WHEN a developer needs test files THEN they SHALL find them organized in the tests directory structure
4. WHEN a developer works with temporary files THEN they SHALL be contained in appropriate temporary directories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want backward compatibility maintained so that existing imports and functionality continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code imports from ai_video_editor THEN the imports SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN existing scripts reference file paths THEN they SHALL either continue to work or provide clear migration guidance
3. WHEN existing documentation references file locations THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect new locations
4. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a documentation user, I want all documentation to remain accessible and properly cross-referenced so that I can find information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses documentation THEN all internal links SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN a user looks for specific documentation THEN they SHALL find clear navigation paths
3. WHEN documentation references code examples THEN the references SHALL point to correct locations
4. WHEN documentation references tools or scripts THEN the references SHALL be updated to new locations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a configuration manager, I want configuration files organized logically so that I can manage project settings efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are needed THEN they SHALL be organized in a dedicated config directory where appropriate
2. WHEN essential configuration files must remain at root THEN only critical files SHALL be kept there
3. WHEN environment-specific configurations exist THEN they SHALL be clearly separated and documented
4. WHEN configuration files are moved THEN all references SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the reorganization to maintain all testing capabilities so that project quality remains high.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN all existing test functionality SHALL work without modification
2. WHEN test data is needed THEN it SHALL remain accessible in appropriate test directories
3. WHEN validation scripts are executed THEN they SHALL work with the new structure
4. WHEN continuous integration runs THEN all workflows SHALL continue to function correctly
