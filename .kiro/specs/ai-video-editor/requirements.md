# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project creates an **AI-driven content creation system** that transforms raw video into professionally edited, engaging, and highly discoverable content packages. At its core, an **AI Director**, powered by the Gemini API, emulates the role of a human expert, making nuanced creative and strategic decisions. This AI drives the entire workflow, from video editing and audio enrichment to the generation of animated B-roll and SEO-optimized metadata.

The system is built on a unified **ContentContext** architecture, which acts as the AI Director's "notes," ensuring that every component—from the video cutter to the thumbnail generator—works in concert to execute a single, cohesive vision. The system leverages a powerful stack of open-source libraries, including **`movis`** for professional video composition and motion graphics, and **`Blender`** for story-driven character animation. A suite of analysis tools (`ffmpeg-python`, `whisper`, `OpenCV`, `PySceneDetect`) are used to deconstruct the source material for the AI to understand. The result is a publish-ready content package where the video, thumbnails, titles, and tags are all intelligently synchronized for maximum impact and discoverability.

For a detailed technical breakdown of the implementation, including class structures and code snippets, please refer to the **`implementation-details.md`** document.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI-Driven Video Editing

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the AI to act as my professional video editor, analyzing my footage and making intelligent cuts to create a polished, engaging, and well-paced final video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN I provide video clips, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL analyze the content and determine the optimal sequence and timing for cuts, trims, and transitions.
2.  WHEN analyzing the audio, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL identify and remove filler words, long pauses, and other disfluencies to create a clean and professional audio track.
3.  WHEN enhancing the video, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL make decisions about color correction, lighting adjustments, and audio enrichment to improve the overall quality.
4.  WHEN processing is complete, THEN the final video, assembled by **`movis`**, SHALL reflect the **AI Director's** creative decisions, resulting in a professionally edited and engaging product.

### Requirement 2: Intelligent B-Roll Generation

**User Story:** As an educational content creator, I want the AI to automatically create and insert relevant B-roll, such as animated formulas, graphs, and character animations, to make my content more engaging and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN analyzing the content, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL identify opportunities for B-roll and determine the most appropriate type of visualization (e.g., a `movis` motion graphic, a `Blender` character animation).
2.  WHEN a data-driven concept is detected, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL instruct **`movis`** to generate a precise, animated visualization of the chart, graph, or concept.
3.  WHEN a narrative or conceptual explanation is detected, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL instruct **`Blender`** to generate a character-based animation that visually explains the concept.
4.  WHEN the B-roll is generated, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL determine the optimal placement and timing for its insertion into the main video timeline.

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered SEO and Metadata Generation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the AI to act as my SEO expert, researching current trends and generating a complete, optimized metadata package that will maximize my video's discoverability on YouTube.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN the content is analyzed, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL perform a thorough keyword research based on the video's topic, analyzing current trends, search volumes, and competitor content.
2.  WHEN the research is complete, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL generate a set of 3-5 highly optimized YouTube titles that are designed to be catchy and SEO-friendly.
3.  WHEN creating the description, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL write a comprehensive and engaging summary that incorporates the top keywords and includes relevant timestamps.
4.  WHEN suggesting tags, THEN the **AI Director** SHALL generate a list of 10-15 relevant tags, combining broad and specific terms to maximize reach.
5.  WHEN the process is complete, THEN the system SHALL provide a complete, publish-ready metadata package that is synchronized with the video content and thumbnails.
