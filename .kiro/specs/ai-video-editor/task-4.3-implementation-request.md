# Implementation Request for Gemini Flash 2.5

## Task: Implement ContentIntelligenceEngine (Task 4.3 - Phase 2)

### Context
This is **Phase 2** of the collaborative development workflow for task 4.3. Phase 1 (specification) has been completed by Kiro. You are now responsible for implementing the ContentIntelligenceEngine according to the detailed specification.

### Specification Location
**Primary Specification**: `.kiro/specs/ai-video-editor/task-4.3-specification.md`
**Shared Memory**: `.kiro/shared_memory.json` (contains architectural patterns and requirements)

### Implementation Requirements

#### 1. Read All Context First
Before starting implementation, you MUST read:
- `.kiro/specs/ai-video-editor/task-4.3-specification.md` (complete specification)
- `.kiro/shared_memory.json` (architectural patterns and integration requirements)
- `ai_video_editor/modules/intelligence/ai_director.py` (existing AI Director for integration)
- `ai_video_editor/core/content_context.py` (ContentContext data model)
- `ai_video_editor/core/exceptions.py` (error handling patterns)

#### 2. Implementation Deliverables
You must create:
1. **Main Implementation**: `ai_video_editor/modules/intelligence/content_intelligence.py`
2. **Comprehensive Tests**: `tests/unit/test_content_intelligence.py`
3. **Integration Example**: `examples/content_intelligence_example.py`
4. **Update Shared Memory**: Store implementation results for Phase 3 review

#### 3. Quality Standards
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations for all methods
- **Docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation with Args, Returns, Raises
- **Error Handling**: Use ContentContextError base class with context preservation
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage with comprehensive mocking
- **Performance**: Meet benchmarks specified in the specification
- **Integration**: Follow ContentContext integration patterns from shared memory

#### 4. Research Requirements
Before implementation, research:
- **Context7**: Get latest documentation for any libraries you need
- **DDG Search**: Research best practices for content analysis and decision algorithms
- **Memory**: Store research insights and implementation patterns

#### 5. Architectural Compliance
Ensure your implementation:
- Follows ContentContext integration patterns from shared memory
- Uses established error handling patterns
- Integrates seamlessly with existing AI Director
- Stores all decisions in ContentContext for downstream execution
- Implements comprehensive testing with mocking strategies

#### 6. Testing Strategy
Create comprehensive tests including:
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Mock ContentContext with various content types
- Mock AIDirectorPlan for coordination testing
- Error handling and graceful degradation tests
- Performance benchmarks for decision generation
- Integration tests with existing components

#### 7. Documentation
Include:
- Complete docstrings for all classes and methods
- Usage examples in the example file
- Integration notes for working with AI Director
- Performance characteristics and optimization notes

### Success Criteria
Your implementation will be reviewed in Phase 3 for:
- ✅ **Architectural Compliance**: Follows ContentContext patterns
- ✅ **Specification Adherence**: Implements all required methods and data structures
- ✅ **Integration Quality**: Works seamlessly with existing AI Director
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage with comprehensive mocking
- ✅ **Performance**: Meets all specified benchmarks
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, error handling
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete examples and integration guides

### Workflow Instructions
1. **Research Phase**: Use available tools to research best practices
2. **Implementation Phase**: Create all required files following specification
3. **Testing Phase**: Implement comprehensive test suite
4. **Documentation Phase**: Create examples and update shared memory
5. **Completion**: Update shared memory with implementation status for Phase 3 review

### Important Notes
- This is a **collaborative task** - your implementation will be reviewed by Kiro in Phase 3
- Follow the established architectural patterns from shared memory
- Ensure seamless integration with existing components
- Focus on quality and comprehensive testing
- Store all insights and patterns in Memory for future reference

### Next Steps
After completing implementation:
1. Update `.kiro/shared_memory.json` with implementation status
2. Store key insights and patterns in Memory
3. Indicate readiness for Phase 3 review by Kiro

Begin implementation now following the detailed specification and architectural requirements.
