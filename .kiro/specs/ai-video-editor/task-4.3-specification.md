# Task 4.3: Content Intelligence and Decision Engine - Detailed Specification

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation of the `ContentIntelligenceEngine` class, which acts as an intelligent coordinator between content analysis results and the AI Director's creative decisions. The engine analyzes content patterns to make data-driven recommendations for editing decisions, B-roll placement, transitions, and pacing optimization.

## Architecture Integration

### Relationship with Existing Components

```
ContentContext (Analysis Results) 
    ↓
ContentIntelligenceEngine (Decision Logic)
    ↓
AI Director (Creative Execution)
    ↓
Enhanced Editing Plan (Final Output)
```

The ContentIntelligenceEngine sits between content analysis and creative execution, providing intelligent recommendations that the AI Director can incorporate into its comprehensive editing plan.

## Integration Requirements

### ContentContext Integration

The ContentIntelligenceEngine must:
1. **Read from ContentContext**: Extract all analysis results including transcript, emotional peaks, visual highlights, and key concepts
2. **Write to ContentContext**: Store all recommendations and enhanced plans for downstream modules
3. **Update Processing Metrics**: Track processing time, decision count, and confidence scores
4. **Handle Context Errors**: Implement graceful degradation when analysis data is incomplete

### AI Director Coordination

The engine must work seamlessly with the existing `FinancialVideoEditor`:
1. **Accept AIDirectorPlan**: Process existing creative decisions from AI Director
2. **Enhance Decisions**: Add intelligence-based recommendations to improve the plan
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: Handle cases where recommendations conflict with AI Director decisions
4. **Maintain Creative Vision**: Ensure intelligence recommendations support the AI Director's creative intent

### Error Handling

All methods must implement comprehensive error handling:
1. **ContentContextError**: For invalid or incomplete context data
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing with reduced functionality when possible
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Lower confidence scores when working with incomplete data
4. **Recovery Strategies**: Provide fallback recommendations when primary analysis fails

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage

**Target**: Minimum 90% test coverage

**Test Categories**:
1. **Method Testing**: Test each public method with various input scenarios
2. **Data Structure Testing**: Validate all dataclass serialization/deserialization
3. **Integration Testing**: Test coordination with mocked AI Director plans
4. **Error Handling Testing**: Test all error conditions and recovery paths
5. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark decision generation speed

### Mock Data Requirements

**ContentContext Mocks**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_educational_context():
    return ContentContext(
        content_type=ContentType.EDUCATIONAL,
        audio_transcript=mock_financial_transcript,
        emotional_markers=[mock_emotional_peaks],
        visual_highlights=[mock_visual_highlights],
        key_concepts=["compound interest", "diversification", "risk management"]
    )

@pytest.fixture
def mock_ai_director_plan():
    return AIDirectorPlan(
        editing_decisions=[mock_editing_decisions],
        broll_plans=[mock_broll_plans],
        metadata_strategy=mock_metadata_strategy,
        # ... other required fields
    )
```

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Complete Data**: Full ContentContext with all analysis results
2. **Partial Data**: Missing some analysis components
3. **Empty Data**: Minimal ContentContext for error handling
4. **Complex Content**: High concept density for pacing optimization
5. **Simple Content**: Low complexity for different pacing strategies
