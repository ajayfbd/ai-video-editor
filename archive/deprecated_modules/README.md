# Deprecated Modules

This directory contains modules that were consolidated during Phase 2 reorganization.

## Consolidated Modules

### utils/cache_manager.py
- **Replaced by**: `core/cache_manager.py` (enhanced with backward compatibility)
- **Reason**: Duplicate functionality - core version is more comprehensive
- **Migration**: All imports updated to use `core.cache_manager.CacheManager`

### utils/error_handling.py  
- **Replaced by**: `core/exceptions.py` (enhanced with ContentContext-specific errors)
- **Reason**: Duplicate functionality - core version provides complete exception hierarchy
- **Migration**: All imports updated to use `core.exceptions.ContentContextError` and related classes

## Impact
- Eliminated code duplication
- Centralized error handling and caching functionality
- Improved maintainability with single source of truth
- Maintained backward compatibility through aliases

These files are preserved for reference but should not be used in new code.
